In less than a year, Bruce proposed to Julianne, and the two married on May 13, 1985, in front of family and friends, but also paparazzi because Bruce was already a celebrity. Unfortunately, their relationship deteriorated over time, and the pair opted to divorce three years into their marriage, with Julianne beginning proceedings and citing irreconcilable differences, and their marriage legally terminated in March 1989. Bruce’s involvement with Patti Scialfa, whom he married in 1991 and is still married to now, played a role. Julianne, on the other hand, has remained unmarried and has never married again.&nbsp;Phillips and Bruce never had children.</p><h2><span id=Julianne_Phillips-_Professional_Career>Julianne Phillips- Professional Career</span></h2><p>Julianne began her modeling career in her early twenties and had a professional contract signed with the Elite Modeling Agency just a few years later, soon earning up to $2,000 per day from her numerous ventures, considerably boosting her wealth. She continued her ascent to stardom by participating in music videos, including those for the rock band 38 Special, among others, which allowed her to pursue a career as an actress.</p><p>Julianne made her acting debut in 1984 in the television film “Summer Fantasy,” co-starring Ted Shackelford and Michael Gross, and the following year in the romantic drama “His Mistress,” co-starring Robert Urich and Cynthia Sikes. Julianne’s film roles include the romantic comedy-drama film “Skin Deep,” starring John Ritter, Vincent Gardenia, and Alyson Reed, and the comic picture “Fletch Lives,” starring Chevy Chase and Hal Holbrook, both in 1989.</p><p>Julianne was gaining popularity as an actress when she was cast as Francesca ‘Frankie’ Reed Margolis in the TV drama series “Sisters,” which aired from 1991 to 1996, with Julianne appearing in nearly 100 episodes of the Golden Globe Award-nominated series that launched her career, alongside Swoosie Kurtz, Selma Ward, and Patricia Kalember. While on the show, she explored other projects, and as a result, she starred in the television film “Getting Up and Going Home” in 1992, followed by “A Vow to Kill” and “Original Sins,” both in 1995, co-starring with Mark Harmon and Ron Perlman in the latter. Julianne stayed in the public eye for a year after “Sisters” ended, appearing in the television film “Tidal Wave: No Escape” and the film “Allie & Me” before retiring.</p><p>Also Read, <a href=#>Donovan Clingan</a>, <a href=#>Mackenzie Grimsley</a>, and <a href=#>Katyajin</a>.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Musician</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Carin Kingsland</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>Chai Hansen</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpaWys7%2FTmqmsm6Whwba%2BxGeaqKVfn8KttcCnpZ5loJ22rbjIqapo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./iman-shumpert-bio-net-worth-height-girlfriend-and-career.html><span>←</span><span>Iman Shumpert : Bio, Net Worth, Height, Girlfriend And Career</span></a>
