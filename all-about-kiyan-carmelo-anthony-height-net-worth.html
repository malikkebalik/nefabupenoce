<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>All About Kiyan Carmelo Anthony Height &amp;amp; Net Worth</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Kiyan Carmelo Anthony is an up-and-coming Basketball player. He has played for Team Melo in EYBL's 15U league. He is the son of NBA Lakers Carmelo Anthony.</p><p>Kiyan is an athlete from Brooklyn, born on <strong>March 7, 2007</strong>. The article tries to provide insight into the life of one of the fastest-rising names in the scene.</p><h2>Kiyan Carmelo Anthony Ranking: Is Listed In Top 25 Recruits</h2><p>Kiyan's career looks promising because he has achieved a good spot in his career as a high school boy. He is visibly thriving in his career, as he was recently listed in the Top 25 recruits in the class of <strong>2025</strong>.</p><p>The young prodigy has already made quite a name for himself. He has played for Bryant University's team Bryant Bulldogs where he announced himself. His performances landed him an offer from George Mason University.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/11/8/313122629_139681642150859_2519663207457571420_n%20(1)-1667902646680.jpg><p>He aims to leave a more significant legacy on the court than his father. He had to say the following in his interview with <i>The Hoop Group</i>:</p><p>I want to be one of the best players in the country. Everything's going to pay off. I can really do everything on the court. Shooting the ball is like my lethal weapon. But I've been working on being able to create my own shot. I think what separates me is my work ethic. I'm in the gym almost every day. I don't really think anyone is working as hard as me.</p><h2>His Parent Carmelo & Alani's Relationship</h2><p>Kiyan's parents, <strong>Carmelo Anthony</strong> and <strong>Alani Vasquez</strong> have had a dramatic relationship. People would typically have a hard time keeping up with all of it.</p><p>The two first met each other through a mutual friend, DJ Clue. Soon after, they hit it off and started seeing each other. A while later, the couple got engaged in<strong> December 2004</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/11/8/rs_1080x1920-190703144840-1080.carmelo-lala-anthony.ct.070319%20(1)-1667903189413.jpg><p>It took many years for them to take their relationship to the next level finally. The couple exchanged their wedding vows on <strong>July 10, 2010</strong>, in New York in front of a large crowd of <strong>320</strong> guests. Their wedding was also taped for a television show for the fans to watch.</p><p>After seven years of married life, things didn't work out, and they separated in <strong>April 2017</strong>. Their relationship didn't end there as the couple got back together the following year, in <strong>December 2018</strong>. Unfortunately, their second spell didn't go as planned, as Alani divorced him and ended things forever.</p><h2>Kiyan's Father Alleged Scandal</h2><p>Kiyan's parent's marriage has ended, and it wasn't a pleasant journey. Carmelo Anthony found himself headlining tabloids when the news broke out that he was seen with another woman.</p><p>The woman has been identified as <strong>Sara Smiri</strong>. The paparazzi spotted him with her in a yatch together. The news spread like wildfire and soon started affecting the family of the NBA player.</p><p>On the other hand, Carmelo&nbsp;defended himself, saying he wasn't cheating on his wife. The woman was married, and her husband was also with them. He also called out the media for reporting the incident without fact-checking it.</p><p>In support of that, Carmelo defended himself in an Interview with <i>TMZ Sports</i>. He said:</p><p>All them bloggers that's trying to put that out there, that sh*t is not cool at all. That's not cool at all. Let that family be they family, they married. The only reason i'm addressing this is because this is affecting my family now and you got me out here looking crazy. Usually I won't address this, but I had to address this. Can't let this one slide, because this s*** ain't cool no more. Peace.</p><h2>What Is The Net Worth of Kiyan Carmelo Anthony?</h2><p>Kiyan Carmelo Anthony may not legally vote, but he is already making a lot of money.

He has been featured in a Jordan ad with his father, Carmelo Anthony promoting his sneaker, the Melo M12.</p><h2>Kiyan Carmelo Anthony Height & Weight:</h2><p>Basketball players are known to be tall, but Kiyan, at such a young age, is already making conversation for his height. The young athlete is already<strong> 6 Feet 3 Inches </strong>tall<strong> </strong>(190.5 cm).</p><p>He received his genes from his father Carmelo Anthony, who is <strong>6 Feet 7 Inches</strong> (201 cm) tall.

She teamed up with <a href=# rel=nofollow>National Psoriasis Foundation</a>, got herself involved in an awareness campaign, and shared her stories and experiences with the world.</p><h2>Kiyan's Parents Televised Wedding</h2><p>Alani Vasquez and Carmelo Anthony didn't conduct a private wedding, a common trope among celebrities. Instead, it was televised to the whole world.</p><figure class=media></figure><p>Their wedding was recorded by <i>VH1</i> and aired on their show <i>La La's Full Court Wedding</i>. Kiyan was also present in the front. He was only three years old at the time, so he probably doesn't remember much of it. But, at least he has highly produced video footage of his parent's marriage in case he wants to see it.</p><h2>Is He Present On Social Media?</h2><p>Want to learn more about Kiyan? He is on Instagram and Twitter.
