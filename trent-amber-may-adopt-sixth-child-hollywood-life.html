With Liz successfully moved out, Anna is eager to follow suit, but everyone wonders when Jonah will finally fly the coop. Even with some of the kids out of the house, the family still finds ways to spend time together. Since COVID led to the cancellation of the annual Little People conference, the Johnstons gather a group of little people for a vacation in Florida. The whole family attends, including Liz’s boyfriend, Brice, who fits right in, even though he is average size. Having recently celebrated their two-year anniversary, the family is curious if Brice will soon become an official member of the Johnston family. Back home, the family celebrates Alex and Emma’s 16th birthday with a backyard luau. 7 Little Johnstons will air Tuesdays at 9 p.m. on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe5BqZnBlnJ7BtbjEZqGooJ6owbC60marq5mZobKzedOrnKesXZa6o7HRZpidp6Cptq%2BzjKygsayYYrCptcudZK%2BhlJq8cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meet-floyd-mayweather-jr-son-devion-cromwell.html><span>←</span><span>Meet Floyd Mayweather Jr Son Devion Cromwell</span></a>
