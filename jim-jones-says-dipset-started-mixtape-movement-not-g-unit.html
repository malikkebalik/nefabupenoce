And it wasn’t a crew mixtape. We were making real albums and putting them out as mixtapes. G-Unit was doing replays of other people’s beats and making mixtapes.”</p><p>He continued: “It was a big difference. We was using our mixtapes as albums to promote our real albums, and off those mixtapes, we were taking singles that the people started loving and started putting them on our real albums.</p><p>“But even in that, we put the Dipset mixtape out first before G-Unit put their mixtape out. Now go Google it.”</p><p></p><p>The Diplomats and G-Unit both released their first mixtape in 2002, with Diplomats Volume 1 coming out before G-Unit’s 50 Cent is the Future that summer. Both tapes would lay down the path for the groups to reach superstardom and elevate the leaders of the respective groups, <a href=# rel=noopener>Cam’ron</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>50 Cent</a>.</p><p>Although Dipset may have bragging rights when it comes to dropping first, they can’t say they released more mixtapes than 50 and his crew.
