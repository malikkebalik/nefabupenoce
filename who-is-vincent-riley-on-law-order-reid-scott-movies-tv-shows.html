Reid Scott joined the cast of Law & Order in Season 23 as Detective Vincent Riley. So, <a href=# rel=noopener>who is Vincent Riley and what is there to know about him</a>? Keep reading for all the details on the new character.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Law & Order</a> is the flagship series in the eponymous franchise. It focuses on the detectives of the Manhattan North Homicide Squad in the&nbsp;27th Precinct, as well as the prosecutors of the&nbsp;Manhattan District Attorney’s Office. Both groups work together to investigate and pursue justice in New York City. The series was created by Dick Wolf and premiered in 1999. It is one of the longest-running scripted American primetime series, second to its spinoff Law & Order: SVU.&nbsp; Following a 12-year hiatus, the show returned in 2022 with a handful of original cast members and several new ones.</p><p>Reid Scott made his Law & Order debut in the Season 23 premiere, which aired on Jan. 18, 2024. He replaced Jeffery Donovan, who <a href=# rel=noopener>was let go for creative reasons</a> after playing Detective Frank Cosgrove for seasons 21 and 22. Learn more about Scott’s character below.</p><h2>Who is Vincent Riley on Law & Order?</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Law-Order.jpg alt="Law & Order" width=923 height=539 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Who is Vincent Riley? Vincent Riley is a new detective in the 27th Precinct’s Homicide Squad and Detective Jalen Shaw’s (Mehcad Brooks) new partner. He reports to Lt. Kate Dixon (played by Camryn Manheim), who personally recruited him onto the squad. As it turns out, he and Dixon have some history. As Manheim told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">TV Insider</a> at the Season 23 premiere, Dixon has known Riley “for a long time.” She continued: “He’s been on the force for a long time. She’s actually been trying to get him over there and it’s just been due to a lot of darker circumstances. It’s been a challenge, but that all comes to light in Episode 4.”</p><p>Riley’s dark past surfaced in the third episode, which saw the detective testify against the suspect of one of his old cases. During the trial, viewers learned that Riley had been suspended for six months at his previous precinct for punching an NYPD police captain and drinking on the job.</p><p>His credibility was questioned, but Lt. Dixon, who worked with him at the precinct, revealed that he was defending her. The police captain he hit was apparently a “sexist son of a b—-” and had called Dixon “something he shouldn’t have,” as she told Assistant District Attorney Nolan Price (Hugh Dancy). “I had to fight like hell to get him over here. I called in every single favor I had so I’d really appreciate it if you just take it easy on him, ok?” she told Price. “He threw a punch for me, who does that? And as stupid and as reckless as it was, I appreciate what he did.”&nbsp;Additionally, Riley was going through some personal issues, as his father was dying at the time and his wife and children left him.</p><p>Brooks spoke about his on-screen partner’s past ahead of the Season 23 premiere, telling <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">NBC Insider</a>: “[Riley] kind of on a redemptive track and he has some things to make up for and Shaw finds out a little late and that doesn’t go over too well, but we love conflict.” He added that Scott is “an incredible actor,” noting: “We’re lucky to have him. He’s the right choice.”</p><p>Scott is best known for starring in HBO’s Veep and the final season of Amazon Prime’s The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. He’s also appeared in American Horror Stories, Black-ish, Will & Grace, Curb Your Enthusiasm and more.</p><p>Law & Order Season 23 airs on NBC on Thursdays at 8 p.m. EST and streams on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Peacock</a>.</p><p><strong>For more on Law & Order, check out this gallery on the <a href=# rel=noopener>Law & Order franchise stars’ real-life partners</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmrKeRpcBwusSwqmhvYWmGcoKOr6Cnm5WjwW6%2ByKWcsmWclsRuu9GdnKtn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./update-walewska-oliveira-death-cause-and-obituary-details-explored-the-talks-today.html><span>←</span><span>Update Walewska Oliveira Death Cause And Obituary Details Explored The Talks Today</span></a>
