Wife Of Steven Yeun</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Steven Yeun has balanced a demanding acting career with an amazing marriage to Joana Pak. Steven Yeun is a well-known actor whose credits include The Walking Dead and the Oscar-winning film Minari.</strong></p><p>He has a leading role in the new Netflix comedy Beef. His marriage to Joana Pak spans over six years. Steven Yeun, 39 years old, is an established Hollywood actor who rose to prominence for his role as Glenn in The Walking Dead.</p><p>Steven received his first nomination for an Academy Award in 2021 for his performance in the drama film Minari. He was the first Asian-American actor to receive the Best Actor nomination.</p><p>Now, Steven stars alongside Ali Wong in the new Netflix series Beef, a dark comedy. Steven’s 36-year-old wife, Joana Pak, is the one person with whom he has absolutely no conflict.</p><p>Steven’s acting job is extremely demanding, yet he has always made his marriage a top priority.</p><p>Steven and Joana met shortly before his career took off on The Walking Dead, so they had to begin their relationship long-distance.</p><p>Fortunately, Joana has always supported her husband’s job, even when it required him to spend time away from her and their two children. Here is all the information you need about Steven’s spouse and their remarkable marriage.</p><h2><span id=Joana_Pak_is_the_spouse_of_Steven_Yeun>Joana Pak is the spouse of Steven Yeun</span></h2><p>Joana, a native of Arkansas, has a very different career path than her Michigan-born spouse. She is a freelance photographer who publishes her beautiful images on Flickr. Steven appears in many of Joana’s photographs.</p><p>Her Flickr page has received nearly 196,000 views. Joana is not on Instagram, in contrast to her husband who has over 3 million followers. Joana attended Columbia College before becoming a full-time photographer, where she met her future spouse.</p><h2><span id=How_Did_Steven_Meet_Joana>How Did Steven Meet Joana?</span></h2><p>Steven and Joana met in Chicago, where Steven was employed by the Second City comedy theater, through a mutual friend. However, Joana was in a relationship at the time, so she did not meet Steven until a year later at the bar where he worked.</p><p><strong>“I invited Jo out with two other female friends, which was the worst decision in history,” Steven told GQ. “Probably because I hadn’t dated in such a long time, and at that time I was like, ‘You know what? Simply, I won’t let her know how I feel about her. I was acting stupid. Just lousy moves,” he declared. “Thereafter, we parted ways, and I saw her every day for the remainder of the year.”</strong></p><p>However, Steven and Joana were separated for some time due to his involvement in The Walking Dead, which was filmed in Georgia.</p><p>Joana told Martha Stewart Weddings in an interview that her husband spent half the year in Atlanta. “I visited Chicago. We were essentially everywhere.”</p><h2><span id=Wedding_of_Steven_Joana>Wedding of Steven & Joana</span></h2><p>The long-distance relationship between Steven and Joana endured, and in August 2015, the Nope actor proposed to the love of his life.</p><p>In front of 220 guests, the pair wed in December 2016 at the Paramour Estate in Los Angeles. Elliot Chung, a relative of Joana, officiated the event. Joana wore traditional Korean attire for her wedding.</p><p>Steven told Martha Steward Weddings,</p><p><strong>“We didn’t make anything sacred,” adding that they “made the ceremony very relaxed and focused on a greater message of love.” Joana stated that they did nothing remarkable to conclude the ceremony. “A natural conclusion to a wonderful day,” she remarked.</strong></p><h2><span id=The_Offspring_of_Steven_Joana>The Offspring of Steven & Joana</span></h2><p>The couple Steven and Joan have two children. Their son Jude Malcolm was born on March 17, 2017, St. Patrick’s Day. On Instagram, Steven announced the arrival of his son with a photo of the infant’s small hand.</p><p><strong>“We are healthy. “Lots and lots of love,” he said in the now-deleted post.</strong></p><p>In April 2019, Steven and Joana welcomed their second child, a daughter. They have not yet disclosed the name of their daughter. On Instagram, Steven does not upload any images of his children.</p><h2><span id=Steven_Joana8217s_Top_Moments>Steven & Joana’s Top Moments</span></h2><p>Steven and Joana are a somewhat quiet couple, though they have attended some Hollywood parties together throughout the years.</p><p>Notably, Joana attended the 2021 Academy Awards with her husband, who was nominated for Best Actor for Minari. Youn Yuh-Jung, who co-starred with Steven, received the award for Best Supporting Actress.</p><p>Before the 2021 AcadJoana Pakemy Awards, Steven revealed the connection between his wife and the film Minari, which depicts a South Korean immigrant family living in rural America in the 1980s.</p><p>Steven told W Magazine that Minari is primarily about his wife’s family.</p><p><strong>“My wife is Korean but grew up in Arkansas, and her family first made their money by chicken sexing. They gave me some tips on how to work with the chicks,” he also said.</strong></p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: https://popularbio.com/andy-rubin-net-worth-of-2022/"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1086017,"3":{"1":0},"9":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-hyperlink=https://popularbio.com/andy-rubin-net-worth-of-2022/><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Also Read: https://popularbio.com/andy-rubin-net-worth-of-2022/</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Television personlaity</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>All About Christine Adams !
