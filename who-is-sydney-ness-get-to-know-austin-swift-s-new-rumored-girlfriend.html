Her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">birthday falls</a> on July 21, although the model seems uninterested in sharing her birthday on social media. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>There seem to be no birthday posts on her Instagram, and she also has not mentioned her age in her few interviews over the years.</p><p>Ness started her modeling career very early. Originally from Wisconsin, the model, who is now signed with Natural Models Management and Ford Models, got into modeling at 15 through her family friends.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Her parents were not that fond of the idea, but they went along with her decision. She even convinced her mother to take her to a casting in Chicago. She got a callback from there, but it was not all as straightforward&nbsp;as it sounds. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><img alt="Sydney Ness, who is rumored to be dating Taylor Swift's brother Austin Swift." height=979 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodmask.com/uploads/images/hmalbum/Sydney-ness-dating-Austin-Swift.jpg width=750 ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Sydney Ness, who is rumored to be dating Taylor Swift's brother Austin Swift.</strong> (Photo: Sydney Ness/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>At 5 feet 11 inches tall (now) and a body that was considered being a&nbsp;plus-size then, she was given two options — either lose weight or see what happens naturally over time (she was only 15 when this happened) and sign a contract with agencies as a plus-size model, a new thing at the time. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She went with the second option.</p><p>"I had always been into sport and had always been super healthy and granted, I was a little bigger than most, but I am also six foot tall," she said during her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with Taylor Magazine</a> in December 2017. "I didn’t think much of it and I just thought I would give it a go."</p><p>After a few local modeling gigs, she went to New York for a while. Then, she took time off from modeling during a stressful time in her life — she even lost weight, and people's comments insinuating she looked fine with lost weight nearly got her into the mindset of thinking being thinner was the way to go. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Right around this time — which caused her so much stress she even stopped going to college&nbsp;— she almost decided to lose weight and go into "straight-sized" modeling. But, Natural Models caught her attention at the right time, and she has been with the agency since then.</p><p>She was living in LA when the interview took place, but she is back in New York now.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Sydney Ness and Austin Swift’s Dating Rumors</h2><p>Ness and Swift's dating rumors began on September 3, 2022, when the rumored couple was spotted taking a <a href=# rel="follow noopener">casual stroll</a> in New York on September 1, 2022. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Both were dressed in casual outfits — he was donning a white shirt with darker blue jeans and a pair of brown shoes, whereas she had a black top on with grey pants and white shoes — as they walked down the street hand-in-hand.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Dating rumors began circulating around on the internet immediately as the hand-holding immediately provided people with enough material to speculate about their dating life. Neither, however, has confirmed nor denied the rumors yet.</p><p>This seems to be the first dating rumor they&nbsp;have about them on the internet. Neither Ness nor Swift have been linked with other people in the past, at least on the web.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaK%2BYpHqqv4yssJ2mla56r7HSrGSdmaSeu6h6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wayne-newton-s-net-worth-kahawatungu.html><span>←</span><span>Wayne Newton's Net Worth - KahawaTungu</span></a>
