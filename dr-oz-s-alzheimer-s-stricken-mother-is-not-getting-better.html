She's not getting better...but she's not getting worse either."</p><p class=Zg>In the under-two-minute clip, Oz let viewers know that he speaks to his mom every day, regularly mentioning those things that he thinks she should always remember.</p><p class=Zg>Alzheimer's disease is an incurable brain ailment that causes permanent memory loss and deteriorating thinking skills. Oz acknowledged all the messages of support fans had sent his way.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Nominee Dr. Oz attends the Entertainment Studios Daytime Emmies 2019 on May 05, 2019 in Pasadena, California. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=Zg><strong class=Xg>HE URGES FANS TO BE ON THE LOOKOUT</strong></p><p class=Zg>In return, he urged them to be on the lookout for signs of the illness and to do something about the situation early if it ever arises in their family. For his part, Oz regrets not taking steps sooner.</p><p class=Zg>The medical talk show host <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.oprahmag.com/entertainment/a28964176/dr-oz-mother-alzheimers-disease/>admitted</a> that he overlooked certain symptoms that "were there all along." He listed them out then told fans to start therapies as soon as possible.</p><p class=Zg>He finished with a message of hope that more effective treatments for Alzheimer's would be found in the near future. For now, we should all be taking care of ourselves amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p class=Zg><strong class=Xg>FEELING GUILTY FOR OVERLOOKING SIGNS</strong></p><p class=Zg>Back <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://abcnews.go.com/US/dr-oz-reveals-mom-alzheimers-describes-painful-realization/story?id=65482748">in September</a>, Oz expresses his deep guilt and regret about his mom's diagnosis even more. "Hearing the official diagnosis was devastating," he <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://twitter.com/DrOz/status/1171045948753137664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1171045948753137664&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fabcnews.go.com%2FUS%2Fdr-oz-reveals-mom-alzheimers-describes-painful-realization%2Fstory%3Fid%3D65482748">wrote</a> at the time.</p><p class=Zg>It was just as bad, he said, that the signs were always there and he'd just not noticed them. In hindsight, Oz could easily point out certain behaviors of his mom that reflected her diagnosis.</p><p class=Zg>Despite his pain, Oz took the opportunity to help others who might encounter similar signs. He posted his mom's story on his <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.doctoroz.com/article/dr-oz-my-mom-has-alzheimer-s-i-completely-missed-signs>website</a> as well as six red flags that one should never ignore.</p><p class=Zg>Oz further revealed that he has the APOE4 Alzheimer's gene, meaning he's at high risk of getting the disease as well. If he prepares now, he might be able to reverse traits contributing to the disease.</p><p class=Zg><strong class=Xg>WENDY WILLIAMS WANTS TO GO BACK TO STUDIO</strong></p><p class=Zg>Elsewhere, some people are willing to put themselves at risk of getting sick amid the COVID-19 pandemic that's currently plaguing the country. Wendy Williams, for instance, wishes she could go back to work.</p><p class=Zg><a class="zd d" href=#>In March</a>, the talk show host spoke to Dr. Oz about having to stay home and away from her audience, saying she's willing to "risk it" and get back out there despite the early threat.</p><p class=Zg>Since then, Williams and Oz have taken their shows to an at-home virtual platform like everyone else. We hope that both of them are watching their health and taking precautions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtobG5jbHqlvoyosaxlkaHHqbHIppyrq12owbO1wqScp2WdpMGpsdFmoKxlnqTBb7TTpqM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cathy-nesbitt-stein-bio-wiki.html><span>←</span><span>Cathy Nesbitt-Stein Bio (Wiki)</span></a>
