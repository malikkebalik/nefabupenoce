Find it out! <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>What is Danny Carey's Net Worth?</h2><p>$40 million was almost a decade ago. The 59-year-old drummer—at times referred to as the best drummer in the world—has been steadily pumping out chartbusters since the start of the '90s.&nbsp;As of 2019, Celebrity Net Worth <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">estimated</a> Danny Carey's net worth to have hit the fifty million dollar mark.</p><p>A significant chunk of his net worth can be credited to the two residential estates that he owns. In December 2016, Danny <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">spent</a> $6.35 million to buy a micro-vineyard property in Malibu off of Emilio Estevez, Charlie Sheen's brother.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><img alt="Danny Carey's Malibu Vineyard Home" height=385 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodmask.com/uploads/images/Danny-carey-malibu-vineyard-home.jpg width=600 ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><strong>Danny Carey's Malibu Vineyard Home</strong> (Photo Source: Google Maps)</p><p>Apart from the Malibu vineyard, Danny also has a home in LA. The Tool drummer <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">bought</a> the property for $695,000 back in 1998 and even planned an expansion a decade later.</p><p>In hopes of adding compounds, Danny had also purchased the adjacent estate for $2.2 million, but the plans were scrapped, and the property was sold off at a loss. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Explore Danny's Acclaimed Career as a Drummer</h2><p>Danny has come a long way since he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">moved</a> to LA in 1986 as a studio drummer for projects like Carole King. For a while, he also played with the Pygmy Love Circus.</p><p>Four years into the LA-life, Danny formed the band Tool with&nbsp;guitarist Adam Jones, vocalist Maynard James Keenan, and bassist Phil D'Amour.</p><p>Three years after its inception, in 1992,&nbsp;Tool released&nbsp;their debut album Undertow. By 1994, the album&nbsp;went platinum, with 2.9 million copies <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sold</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As of today, Undertow is a certified platinum in Canada and double platinum in the US by the&nbsp;Recording Industry Association Of America (RIAA). <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The second album by the metal band is their best-selling album to date. Tool's sophomore released&nbsp;AEnema&nbsp;in1997. The album <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">peaked</a> at number #2 on the&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;200 chart with 3.4 million copies sold. The song went platinum in&nbsp;Canada and Australia, and triple platinum in the US.</p><p>The next two albums,&nbsp;Lateralus&nbsp;from 2001&nbsp;and&nbsp;10,000 Days&nbsp;from 2006, both went platinum across nations and were #1 on the Billboard 200 Chart. The single Schism form the former album even racked a Grammy for the best metal performance in 2002 while the latter album bagged&nbsp;another Grammy for the best recording package. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Besides the band's work, Danny operates a&nbsp;self-titled&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">website</a>&nbsp;through which he&nbsp;sells&nbsp;his merch. The website also lets fans get a closer look at the tools of his trade as it features a sound gallery of a variety of guitars, synths, and drums.</p><h2>New EP On The Way For 2020?</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Because of the whole pandemic situation, Danny's band had to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">cancel </a>their biggest American Tour to date. But, Danny has confirmed that the Tool is not done yet, as they might even release an EP this year. He hinted so in Sunday Live Chat with Cevin Key on August 2020, as per <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Loudwire</a>.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>We kept hoping that we were going to get back out, so we were just kind of, 'Hey, enjoy this while it lasts.' But now it's looking like it could go to the rest of the year, so we need to get the lead out and start functioning. Maybe knock out another EP, at least, or something like that.</p><p>Moreover, Danny revealed that the Tool is without a record label. "We don't have a record deal anymore — we're free agents — so we can kind of release whatever we want to release now, which is a good feeling," said Danny. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGikrquZmHylrc2nsGabkaeyunnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tim-couch.html><span>←</span><span>Tim Couch</span></a>
