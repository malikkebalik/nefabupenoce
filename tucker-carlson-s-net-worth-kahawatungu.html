In 2009, he found a home at Fox News, marking the beginning of a significant chapter. His nightly talk show, “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” debuted in 2016, amplifying his influence in political discourse.</p><p>However, on April 24, 2023, the media landscape witnessed a seismic shift as Fox News terminated Carlson’s contract. This surprising departure occurred just a week after Fox settled a defamation suit with Dominion Voting Systems, contributing to the media industry’s shockwaves. Coincidentally, Don Lemon faced a similar fate at CNN on the same day.</p><p>Beyond television, Carlson co-founded the conservative website The Daily Caller, showcasing his multifaceted engagement in media and politics.
