Her mother, <strong>Ximena Bernales, </strong>became a professional bodybuilder<strong>. </strong>“I grew up watching my mom in the physical fitness space. She was an <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>aerobics</a> instructor throughout the ’90s and later started personal training and bodybuilding before eventually opening her own gym, “she revealed to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Self</a>. &nbsp;“I grew up with an immigrant mother from Chile, and she really taught me work ethic, discipline, and drive, as well as to pursue excellence.”</p><h2><strong><strong><strong>Jess Was A Contestant On So You Think You Can Dance</strong></strong></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>The fitness guru competed on the fourth season of So You Think You Can Dance, making it all the way to the Top Ten. She also used her dancing abilities in a huge Vegas production. “Before I made the transition into the fitness industry for myself, I had an abundant career in dance that started on FOX’s So You Think You Can Dance.&nbsp;I toured the world teaching and performing and was the lead role in a Cirque du Soleil production in Las Vegas,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Path.</a>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong><strong><strong>She Auditioned For Broadway</strong></strong></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>Before she worked in fitness training, Jess tried her luck on the Great White Way — but it ended up being quite the negative experience. “In 2014, I was flat broke in a very dark chapter of my life: I was living in New York City, auditioning for Broadway, and not getting gigs,” she told Self. “I had promised myself a year of “yes,” in which I was going to take any opportunity to meet people, network, and make money—anything to get me out of the space that I was in and to just grow.”</p><h2><strong><strong><strong>Jess Has A Fiancée&nbsp;</strong></strong></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>Jess is happily engaged to <strong>Sophia Urista</strong>, a performer and singer. When the two aren’t on the stage, the cute couple love spending time in the kitchen together. “She’s half Mexican, so a lot of our recipes come from our families,” Jess explained to Self. “We’re always cooking some version of tacos or enchiladas or arroz. It’s very heavily influenced by our Latin culture.” Jess also told the outlet she is proud to be an “openly LGBTQ+ female member” on the Peloton team.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K3pr%2FSZqKippdigXd8j3Fvbmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./yung-gravy-bio-net-worth-age-girlfriend-facts-parents-height-the-talks-today.html><span>←</span><span>Yung Gravy Bio, Net Worth, Age, Girlfriend, Facts, Parents, Height The Talks Today</span></a>
