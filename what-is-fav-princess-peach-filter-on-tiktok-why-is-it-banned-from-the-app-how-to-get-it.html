Find out Why is it banned and how to use this feature and become the beloved princess yourself using the filter.</p><p>TikTok has recently been buzzing with a controversial filter called the “Princess Peach” that has left netizens stunned. The platform is no stranger to provocative filters, and the latest addition to this trend is the “Favorite Princess Peach” filter, which has sparked widespread discussion and raised eyebrows across the internet.</p><p>The “Favorite Princess Peach” filter takes inspiration from the character Princess Peach from the popular Mario video game franchise. However, this filter is not safe for work (NSFW) and aims to shock or offend users by unexpectedly presenting explicit content.</p><p></p><p>When using the filter, users are presented with two images of Princess Peach. The first image shows her with one hand extended and a surprised expression, while the second image is a close-up of Princess Peach standing with her hands crossed.</p><p>To make a selection, users are instructed to tilt their necks toward one of the images. Regardless of which image the user chooses, the other image transforms into an explicit depiction of Princess Peach once the selection is made.</p><h2>What is the TikTok Fav Princess Peach Filter?</h2><p>The “Fav Princess Peach” filter is just one example of the viral “<a href=#>777 filters</a>” that have been circulating on TikTok recently. These filters operate in a similar manner, showcasing explicit content featuring characters from various media properties. Despite TikTok’s efforts to combat them, these filters have been difficult to completely eliminate.</p><p>Interestingly, these filters have sparked entertaining reactions from TikTokers. Although the videos may be heavily edited, the genuine surprise and expressions on users’ faces when they encounter the filter have captivated millions of viewers in the past two days.</p><p>It remains to be seen if the proliferation of 777 filters will be remembered on TikTok as a significant incident akin to the <a href=#>events of December 22nd.</a> Only time will reveal the lasting impact and legacy of these filters on the platform.</p><p>The Princess Peach filter that has gained popularity on TikTok shares similarities with other NSFW filters found on the platform. Users are prompted to choose their preferred image of Princess Peach from two options presented side by side.</p><p>One image shows Princess Peach with a surprised expression, raising one hand, while the other image is a close-up shot of Princess Peach with her hands crossed.</p><p>Regardless of the option chosen, an explicit NSFW image of Princess Peach is revealed, leaving a lasting impact on those who encounter it. This type of filter design is not unique, as similar formats have been used on TikTok to gauge user preferences in various contexts.</p><p>For example, there are variants featuring K-pop groups or idols, as well as filters showcasing TV show characters where users select their favorite character.</p><p>On a broader scale, some filters employ brackets that require users to tilt their heads left and right until they arrive at their preferred choice, such as their favorite K-pop group or song.</p><p>However, the Fav Princess Peach Filter on TikTok has caught many users off guard as they were not prepared for the explicit nature of the images that awaited them after making their selection.</p><p>The Fav Princess Peach Filter revolves around the well-known character Princess Peach from the Super Mario franchise. Initially, some users may have anticipated a comparison between previous animated depictions of Peach and the upcoming Super Mario Bros. Movie.</p><p>However, their expectations quickly turned to shock as they tilted their heads and were unexpectedly exposed to NSFW content featuring Princess Peach.</p><h2>Why is it banned from the App ‘Tiktok’?</h2><p>The Princess Peach filter, known for its explicit and inappropriate content, is no longer available on TikTok, leading users to believe it has been “banned.”</p><p>However, videos showcasing people’s shocked reactions to the filter can still be found on the platform, serving as a warning against participating in such trends.</p><p>Users are actively highlighting the inappropriateness of NSFW filters like the Fav Princess Peach filter and urging others to avoid them. Instead, they encourage engagement with other enjoyable and safe filters.</p><p>Some users express regret and advise against trying such filters, acknowledging that they should have stayed away from them in the first place. The impact of these filters has left users unable to see Princess Peach and other characters in the same light.</p><p>Unfortunately, reports indicate that there are additional NSFW video filters featuring various characters on TikTok, including Mario, the Incredible Hulk, Hello Kitty, Sonic, and even Mr. Clean. This trend has extended to anime characters as well.</p><p>Considering the widespread availability of these NSFW filters on TikTok, it is crucial for parents to regularly monitor their children’s activities and content consumption on the platform.</p><a title=@jamesdoylefitness href=# rel=noopener>@jamesdoylefitness</a><p>Curiousity definitely killed the ginger cat with this one <a title=filters href=# rel=noopener>#filters</a> <a title=princesspeach href=# rel=noopener>#princesspeach</a></p><p><a title="♬ original sound - Protein Bor Papi" href=# rel=noopener>♬ original sound – Protein Bor Papi</a></p><p>It is recommended to stay away from these types of filters until TikTok enforces a complete ban and restricts the creation of such explicit content.</p><p>Therefore, the platform’s users are urging one another to stay away from these and rather take part in other fun filters that are completely safe to use.</p><p>“Should’ve stayed curious instead. Please don’t try this,” wrote one.</p><p>Another added: “I should have minded my own business.”</p><p>“I can never look at Princess Peach the same way after this,” said one.</p><p>Upon checking the application, TikTok already took down and probably banned the filter. Those users who got the chance to play the filter continued to post their videos with their reactions after seeing the photo. Don’t worry; we haven’t encountered a video that did not blur or cover the NSFW filter.</p><h2>How to get it Fav Princess Peach Filter on Tiktok?</h2><p>The TikTok Fav Princess Peach Filter allows users to transform themselves into the beloved character Princess Peach from the Mario video game franchise.
