Both were released early Sunday without any major injuries, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>ESPN</a>. Zhang won by split decision.</p><p>The fight was in stark contrast to the main event, a boring letdown between Israel Adesanya and Yoel Romero.

She revealed earlier this year that 2019 <a href=# rel=noopener>was a difficult year for her</a>.
