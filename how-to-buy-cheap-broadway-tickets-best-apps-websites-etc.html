You’ll also find discounts on <a href=# rel=noopener>BroadwayBox</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>Broadway.com</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>TKTS</a>. Those still longing to see “Hamilton” may want to download the show’s own app and enter the daily $10 ticket HAM4HAM lottery. Looking to throw a few hats in the ring? Download <a href=# rel=noopener>BroadwayADay</a> to be automatically entered in several lotteries of your choosing every day.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Actually, there are three of them. The TKTS booths in Times Square, at Lincoln Center and at South Street Seaport sell tickets discounted up to 50 percent off. The Times Square booth sells only same-day tickets, but its two satellites let you buy tickets to the following day’s matinee. Before you go, check the TKTS app to see what shows are available, and for how much: These days, even half-price Broadway tickets command as much as $100, plus the booth’s $6 service charge. Make sure you have a Plan B, in case your favorite show sells out before you reach the ticket window.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The Theater Development Fund (TDF) is TKTS’ parent organization, and offers other discounts as well. An annual $40 membership fee gives you access to Broadway shows for just $11 to $49 a ticket. Teachers, nonprofit employees, civil servants, students and a number of other groups are eligible for TDF membership, so check their <a href=#>website</a> to see if you can sign up.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Some of the most buzzy Broadway shows release a handful of discounted tickets through daily lotteries. Depending on the show, they may be day-of tickets or for showings within the next few days, and you’ll typically be able to buy up to two tickets for under $50 each. <a href=#>TodayTix</a> and the <a href=#>Hamilton app</a> have some lotteries and BroadwayADay allows you to enter several automatically every day.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Box offices at many Broadway shows <a href=#>sell day-of tickets at steep discounts</a> to fill any empty seats. Sales start when the box offices open: generally, Monday to Saturday at 10 a.m. and Sunday at noon. For very popular shows like “To Kill a Mockingbird” and “Mean Girls,” you may want to start lining up a few hours before then to increase your chances. Tickets are often limited to two per customer. Some shows offer even more steeply discounted rush tickets for students with IDs. <a href=#>Playbill</a> is a good source for the latest rush ticket information.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><a href=#>BroadwayBox</a> and <a href=#>Theatermania</a> often supply discount codes for many shows, both on Broadway and off. They’ll redirect you to major ticket-selling sites like <a href=# rel=noopener>Telecharge</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Ticketmaster</a>. The average service charge per ticket is $10. Other discount sites include <a href=#>TodayTix</a>, which sells rush tickets without your having to plant yourself at the box office.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlfnp7j3FmaXFfnby4edOoZJutqWKwqbHAqWSbqp%2BWsbit2GaropubmsG0ecCtZJqmqWLBqrnEZqCnq5mZsrO%2FjKCsopyVYsGwecGeqq1llJqurb%2BO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./expressing-gratitude-on-her-birthday-2face-s-baby-mama-pero-adeniyi.html><span>←</span><span>Expressing Gratitude on Her Birthday: 2faces Baby Mama, Pero Adeniyi</span></a>
