Fiber-rich foods can also help your cat with her tummy troubles. And while fiber is an essential nutrient for all living things, it is often lacking in commercial cat diets.</p><p>Never, ever give your cat certain veggies, such as onions, chives, and garlic. You should also steer clear of feeding her grapes and raisins as these foods are toxic to felines.</p><p>Try giving your pet some bran cereal. Over-the-counter products, such as psyllium (marketed as Metamucil in the store) will help your cat’s digestive tract get back on track. As we mentioned earlier, consult with your vet before putting your pet on any type of treatment plan.</p><ul><li>Natural remedy for constipation</li><li>Provides your cat with more fiber</li></ul><ul><li>Natural bran cereal can be expensive</li></ul><h3 class=num-head><span id=2_Hydration_Station><span class=dhn>2.</span> Hydration Station</span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>Dehydration is one of the leading causes of constipation</a>.

Avoiding using the litter box could lead to constipation. If you can’t clean your litter box daily, consider adding more to your household. Keep a litter box in the basement, bathroom, or a spare bedroom so your cat always has an immaculate place to do her business.</p><ul><li>Encourages your cat to do her business</li></ul><ul><li>More litter boxes to clean</li></ul><p>Cleaning up after our pets is hardly the most fun part of having them. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel=nofollow><strong>Hepper's Advanced Bio-Enzyme Cat Litter Deodorizer</strong></a> can help with more than just your cat's litter box.
