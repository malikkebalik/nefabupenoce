Could the NFL move a franchise to London full time?
That question has become louder and louder in recent years, especially with Shahid Khan's team set to play two games in London this season.
Khan is also the owner of Fulham in the Premier League."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
