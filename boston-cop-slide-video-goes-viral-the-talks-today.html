The officer was injured in the incident, which went viral on social media and captured the attention of people all over the world.</span></p><p><span>Join us as we investigate how an average moment of fun became an online sensation, exposing the challenges that law enforcement faces in the digital age.</span></p><p><span>On camera, a Boston police officer dressed in full costume was spotted down the kid’s slide at the recently remodeled City Hall Plaza playground. When the cops tried out the slide, they got a much faster ride than they bargained for.</span></p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p><span>The officer’s fall down the slide while still wearing his uniform went viral on social media. It earned millions of views on TikTok.</span></p><p><span>The twisted tube generates loud pounding sounds, similar to shoes shaking in the dryer. The cop comes unexpectedly at the slide’s opening, landing feet first on his stomach. The video shows him straddling the slide’s edge, smacking his head on the opposite side, and then being hurled down the bottom’s rubber surface, loosing his belt and handcuffs as he falls to a stop.</span></p><p><strong><span>SEE ALSO: <span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Singer Lizzo Accused Of $3xual Harassment and Weight-Shaming(See More)</a></span></span></strong></p><p><span>Just before the video finishes, the surprised cop says, “Oh f—k,” as he slowly stands up. A spectator may be heard chuckling and wondering why the slide happened so quickly.</span></p><p><span>On Tuesday afternoon, when reporters questioned Boston Mayor Michelle Wu about the video, she claimed not to have seen it but expressed satisfaction with the renovated play area.</span></p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-51244 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thetalkstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Full-Video-Boston-Cop-Slide-Video-Goes-Viral.png alt="Boston Cop Slide Video Goes Viral" width=702 height=394 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-51244 class=wp-caption-text>Boston Cop Slide Video Goes Viral</p><p><span>We were only there for the weekend Puerto Rican festivities. The newly renovated City Hall Plaza was entirely filled. It was amazing to see so many kids playing near the water features at the playground.</span></p><p><span>One of the traits is the tall slide the officer was utilizing. The playground welcomes kids between the ages of 2 and 12 according to a sign at the entrance.</span></p><p><span>“I’m not sure what happened or the circumstances,” Mayor Wu said. I’ll be sure to check in with the cop, though, to see how he’s doing. If additional signage is required to convey that this location is for children, we may do so.</span></p><p><span>‘Boston 25’ also questioned Boston Police about the video. The agency asserts that the officer was hurt, took care of his medical expenses through insurance, and left the city with no financial burden.</span></p><p><span>The officer did not miss any time, and BPD claims that no disciplinary action would be taken against him. According to Mayor Wu, “Everything has the potential to go viral these days.”</span></p><p>Watch Full Video;</p><span data-mce-type=bookmark class=mce_SELRES_start></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrBorjKrKuonJGue6S7zGidrqScYsOqsMSoZJuno6m8r3nCqKdmq5yesaZ51aKbnqddnLymv4yvoKuZnGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./karthika-nair-wiki-husband-age-net-worth-children.html><span>←</span><span>Karthika Nair Wiki, Husband, Age, Net Worth, Children</span></a>
