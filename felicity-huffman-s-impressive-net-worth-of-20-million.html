She has excelled in film, television, and stage acting since the 1970s. Felicity is widely known for her stellar performances in “Desperate Housewives” and “Sports Night,” which have significantly contributed to her impressive net worth.</p><p>As of early-2017, sources estimate her net worth to be $20 million, predominantly earned through her successful acting career. She has earned numerous awards, including a Golden Globe, Independent Spirit, and Primetime Emmy Awards. As she continues to carve her path in the industry, it’s anticipated that her wealth will burgeon even further.</p><h3>Felicity Huffman: A Distinguished Career</h3><p>Huffman’s formative years were heavily influenced by her mother due to her parents’ divorce a year after her birth. She pursued her education at The Putney School and went on to graduate from Interlochen Arts Academy. Additionally, she further honed her craft at New York University, Circle in the Square, and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.</p><p>In 1982, Felicity made her stage debut and soon became involved in diverse productions. Her Broadway debut came six years later in the play “Speed the Plow.” Notably, in 1995 she gained critical acclaim for her role in “The Cryptogram,” winning her an Obie Award. Over the years, she secured roles in significant productions, leaving an indelible mark on the stage.</p><p>Her foray into the screen began in 1988 with a small role in the film “Things Change.” She went on to appear in various projects, including “Reversal of Fortune,” “The Water Engine,” “Hackers,” and “Golden Years.” Her versatility extended to guest roles in shows like “Chicago Hope,” “The X-Files,” and “Law & Order.” Notably, her role in “The Spanish Prisoner” propelled her to major stardom and led to her portrayal of Dana Whitaker in the successful series “Sports Night,” for which she earned a Golden Globe Award.</p><p>Following her success on stage and in television, Huffman landed a recurring role on the sitcom “Frasier” and took the lead in the long-running series “Desperate Housewives.” Her exceptional work on the show earned her an Emmy Award and two Screen Actors Guild Awards. The series ran for eight seasons until 2012, during which time she also appeared in independent projects like “Transamerica” and “Phoebe in Wonderland.” She further enhanced her filmography with roles in “Rudderless” and “Big Game” opposite Samuel L. Jackson. Subsequent projects, including her critically-acclaimed performance in “American Crime,” continued to bolster her net worth.</p><p>In her personal life, it’s known that Felicity shared a 15-year on-and-off relationship with actor William H. Macy, whom she later married in 1997. The couple has two children and has made joint appearances in various projects. Additionally, they received a star together on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2012. Huffman is also recognized for her advocacy for women’s rights and her candidness about her teenage struggles with anorexia and bulimia.</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Salary</li><li>Quotes</li><li>Facts</li><li>Pictures</li><li>Filmography</li><li>Awards</li></ul><h3>Related posts:</h3><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmidnqSZmLa1xYyhrJ%2BenZa7tHnIpqernaOotrexjKecrWWnpL%2B1tIyonWZqYGK6qrjLoqanZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cincinnati-bengals-vs-pittsburgh-steelers-box-score-november-26-2023.html><span>←</span><span>Cincinnati Bengals vs Pittsburgh Steelers Box Score - November 26, 2023</span></a>
