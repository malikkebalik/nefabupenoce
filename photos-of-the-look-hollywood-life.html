Her head was the scariest part as her face had bulging black speckled eyeballs while her mouth was crusted over and had dried blood dripping out of it. North styled her incredible makeup with a baggy black T-shirt dress with orange graphic patterns it as well as a cropped, zip-up shoulder-length sweatshirt.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Aside from her head, her arms also had makeup on them to look like alien hands.

For the costume, North wore a tight, cropped white and red tube top with a pair of super baggy red and blue branded jeans. A pair of high-waisted boxers, a baggy bomber jacket, and a black belt completed her look.
