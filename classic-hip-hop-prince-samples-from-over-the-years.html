Before Hip Hop became the force against the majority, the eccentric artist had already done his part in shaking up not only the industry, but pop culture. Thirty-new albums (which sold millions worldwide) and a cinematic classic later, his iconic status was solidified long before he was pronounced dead today (April 21) to the shock of the entire planet.</p><p>Everyone <a href=#>within the Hip Hop community</a> from Questlove to Chuck D all hit social media to give their thoughts on the unfortunate news. The creative genius managed to influence the culture in more indirect ways (Future’s <a href=#>Purple Reign</a> easily comes to mind) to more direct ways through sample usage. Utilizing popular sampling website <a href=#>WhoSampled</a>, we track down the ten best Hip Hop Prince samples.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><h2>Kanye West – “Big Brother” (2007)</h2><p><strong>Sampled:</strong> “It’s Gonna Be Lonely” from the album, Prince.</p><p></p><p>Ye’s third studio album Graduation featured a nice breakdown of his relationship with Jay Z through “Big Brother,” where DJ Toomp utilized heartfelt instrumentation for “It’s Gonna Be Lonely.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><h2>Jay Z f.

Shock G and Money-B – “ I Get Around” (1993)</h2><p><strong>Sampled:</strong> “The Ladder” from the album, Around the World in a Day.</p><p></p><p>Around The World in a Day track “The Ladder” was used on Tupac’s Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z. single, empowering the iconic rap legend to earn a gold plaque in the process.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><h2>Makaveli a.k.a. 2Pac: “To Live & Die in LA” (1996)</h2><p><strong>Sampled:</strong> “Do Me, Baby” from the album, Controversy.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“I Get Around” wasn’t the only time Pac used a Prince sample for mainstream eardrums. Showing his pride for Southern California’s biggest city, “To Live & Die in LA” became one of the last videos shot by him before his untimely death in 1996. This one used Controversy slow jam, “Do Me, Baby.”</p><h2>Public Enemy: “Brothers Gonna Work it Out” (1990)</h2><p><strong>Sampled:</strong> “Let’s Go Crazy” from the album, Purple Rain.</p><p></p><p>Fear of a Black Planet single “Brothers Gonna Work It Out” features a sample of “Let’s Go Crazy” that’s actually backwards.
