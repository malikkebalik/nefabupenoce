"Which is cool… I was like, 'Alright. Charm the homie too. Then that way, he can go back and say he's awesome, I love that guy.' And that's what happened."</p><p>Courtney explained Lopez wasn't being entirely truthful about the story, as he was already familiar with her best friend, Nick.</p><h2>Mario Lopez and Wife Have Three Children</h2><p>Two years after their first meeting, Lopez and Courtney welcomed their first child together, daughter Gia Francesca Lopez, on September 11, 2010. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>They <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tied the knot</a> on December 1, 2012, after four years of dating.
