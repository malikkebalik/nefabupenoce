Subsequently, AEG thinks they “have the right to take control of the Young Stoner Life brands, portions of his publishing catalog and the Young Thug trademark” to recoup the $5 million.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>AEG and Young Thug were expected to battle it out in court on October 25, but Thug was arrested on RICO charges in May. Last month, AEG’s legal team asked a judge for a one-year extension, which was granted.</p><p>The trial is tentatively set for October 24, 2023. AEG is seeking at least $6 million in damages, the rights to YSL, the name Young Thug and attorney fees. As for the RICO trial, Young Thug is scheduled to appear in court next January.</p><p>But that’s not even all of Young Thug’s legal woes. Last week, he was sued for $150,000 over an Atlanta concert that was scheduled to take pace in June at the State Farm Arena. Due to his arrest, he was unable to fulfill his obligation and the promoters want their deposit back.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mignWZnZ4R6gI6toK2klWPGsMHNoGStoKWceqm102auoqyYYoOuecuarqytmal6p77OpmSanZdivbOx0p6lratdlsBuvsicpmabkaiybrjOqKSs</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-ultimatum-season-2-who-are-antonio-and-roxanne-wildly-divergent-life-goals-may-chip-away.html><span>←</span><span>The Ultimatum Season 2: Who are Antonio and Roxanne?
