Hall</strong>, 39, is back on set and ready to work harder than ever — and we’re happy to report that he’s recovering well from his battle with Hodgkin’s lymphoma. <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong> caught up with Michael’s wife and Dexter co-star <strong>Jennifer Carpenter</strong>, 30,&nbsp;at the LOVE Benefit for WET (We Empower Together) at The Angel Orensanz Foundation in NYC on Apr. 19, and she told us, “I’m really lucky. Michael is [doing] great. He’s really great!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>On Jan. 13, Michael’s rep confirmed that he was undergoing chemotherapy with success. “I think it’s always easier to be the caretaker than being the one who needs the care taking,” Jennifer told us. “I’ve been so impressed. He’s been so strong and even about it all. He never got down about it or himself. He’s like, ‘OK, this is on my plate. I’ll take care of it.'”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The fifth season of Showtime’s Dexter begins filming in June, and even though Michael will have to wear a wig, he seems to be ready to get back in the game. He was spotted Apr. 19 filming his upcoming comedy, East Fifth Bliss, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>RadarOnline</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>And, as most Dexter fans know, Michael works with his wife Jennifer, who plays Detective Debra Morgan on the show. “It’s really weird,” Jennifer admitted to us. “When we are at work, I see him as Dexter and that’s it. Sometimes we eat lunch together, but we never blur the lines. It’s always really easy to turn on and off.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Though the couple met prior to the show through mutual friends, they really bonded being on set together. “I don’t know that it was one thing,” Jen said of falling in love with her hubby. ” I feel like it was something I knew before I understood it. It was just something that happened before I could explain it.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>We’re overjoyed to hear that Michael is doing so much better and that his marriage and job are going so well! We couldn’t wish for anything better for this happy Hollywood couple. It seems that there’s finally a light at the end of the tunnel for them!</p><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>— Lindsey DiMattina</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>Get More on Michael C.
