The track, which also features Ying Yang Twins, was known as the breakthrough song for the crunk genre.</p><p>The lighthearted moment comes after a few difficult months for Quavo. His nephew and former Migos rhyme partner TakeOff was <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>shot and killed outside a Houston bowling alley on November 1</a>. According to police, the 28-year-old rapper was an innocent bystander to a dice game involving Quavo and other men, which <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>escalated into an argument and before shots were fired</a>.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Prior to TakeOff’s murder, relations had begun to strain between Quavo and Offset. Then according to TMZ,&nbsp; <a class=underline-link href=#>the pair brawled backstage at this year’s Grammys after Quavo refused to let Offset share the stage with him</a> for his performance of “Without You” during the ceremony’s “In Memorium” segment. All involved parties have <a class=underline-link href=#>denied that any fight occurred</a>.</p><p>On the music side of things, Huncho released a new song called “Greatness” in February, and on the track celebrated the cultural impact of the Migos while admitting that TakeOff’s death also meant the death of the group.</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2022/12/offset-struggling-takeoff-death-250x142.jpg alt="Offset Is Still Struggling To Process TakeOff’s Death: ‘Shit Not Easy’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Offset Is Still Struggling To Process TakeOff’s Death: ‘Shit Not Easy’</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>December 22, 2022</p></a><p>“Came in, swept the game like a storm with the muthafuckin’ flow, n-gga, Take did that/ So don’t ask about the group, he gone, we gone, young n-gga it can’t come back, damn!”&nbsp;Quavo raps.</p><p>The song’s accompanying video shows the Georgia native watching old footage of him and TakeOff on TV inside his mansion, while also flexing his jewelry, cars and basketball skills.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>While it’s unclear when relations began to sour between the group, <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>Quavo implied that disloyalty was to blame on Offset’s part</a>&nbsp;during an interview on the&nbsp;Big Facts&nbsp;podcast last October.</p><p>“We stand on real deal loyalty, and sometimes that shit ain’t displayed,” he said at the time. “This ain’t got nothing to do with no label, no paperwork, no [Quality Control Music], nothing.
