Season: Autumn
Once again, Yaga met the mushroom twins. This time, however, it appeared that the mushrooms wanted to aid Yaga in her quest, not the other way around as before. As they finally learned what the reason was behind her setting out on this journey, they suggested that the Forefather’s Eve might be a perfect chance, if not the only chance, to consult Gordana – a mysterious figure who had roamed the land years ago."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Fish in Henrik’s pond to lure him out</h3><p>As per the twins’ words, Henrik the Conjurer needed to be found. His whereabouts were unclear, but he was supposedly fond of fishing. The mushrooms suggested traveling to his old fishing spot so that he might take an interest in someone participating in his beloved pastime, thus revealing himself.</p><p>Without giving it much thought, Yaga set out with a rod and bait at the ready.</p><p>A fish is always a welcome sight, if I might add.</p><h3 class=he-c>2. Bring the goldfish to the fishbowl in the chapel</h3><p>Henrik was still nowhere to be found, but Yaga fished out a rather bony goldfish. It spoke, and while its words did not always make perfect sense, the fish claimed to know Henrik and demanded to be put into a fishbowl in a nearby chapel.</p><p>With no better alternatives for reaching the Conjurer, Yaga complied with the goldfish’s request.</p><h3 class=he-c>3. Find Gordana’s shelloks</h3><p>It turned out Henrik was the goldfish all along. While his mind may have been a bit cloudy, the old conjurer still seemed capable of performing a ritual to contact Gordana. All that he needed were objects relating to the nature of her personality.</p><p>And it so happened that two of her artifacts were not far away.</p><h3 class=he-c>4. Find the Golden Shellok</h3><p>To get to the golden shellok you must complete the quest "<a href=#>Just a Formality</a>".</p><p><h3 class=he-c>5. Find the Silver Shellok</h3></p><h3 class=he-c>6. Bring the shelloks to Henrik</h3><p>Having handled both Boruta’s shady deal and the infamous spider bureaucracy, Yaga was finally in possession of both shelloks. All there was left to do was to get them to Henrik so he could start the ritual.</p><h3 class=he-c>7. Put out the torches</h3><p>The restless spirits could not give poor old Henrik even a moment of respite. The conjurer fish needed all the lights in the chapel to be out so he could perform the ritual, and yet these good-for-nothing incorporeal pests kept lighting them back up.</p><p>Yaga needed to make sure all the lights were out.</p><h3 class=he-c>8. Go back to the twins</h3><p>The ritual backfired horribly. Not only did Yaga not get a chance to speak with the fabled Gordana, but also amidst all the chaos and commotion... Baba appeared.</p><p>By some miracle beyond comprehension, Yaga once again came out of an encounter with this abominable nightmare of a being without so much as a scratch. Sadly, the same could not be said about Henrik. The poor skeleton goldfish seemed to have lost his mind completely and was now left mumbling feverishly in his bowl, with no recollection of reality whatsoever.</p><p>It was time to return to the mushroom twins.</p><h3 class=he-c>9. Quest Completed</h3><p>Borvy and Jack expressed their disappointment at how the ritual had turned out, and promised to take care of Henrik. Whatever had actually happened in the chapel, it was time to leave it behind.</p><h2 class=he-b>User Comments</h2><p>All your comments, suggestions and additions are very welcome and will certainly help other players who visit this site.
