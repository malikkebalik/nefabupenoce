During one of his robberies, he was caught and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sentenced</a>&nbsp;to San Quentin State Prison for seven years. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>While at prison, he&nbsp;used&nbsp;his time by lifting weights at the prison gym. However, his path towards attaining a magnificent physique in jail wasn’t that easy, mainly due to two things—the prison’s food and the guards’ decision to remove weights from the gym.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Nonetheless, he gained muscle and weighed around 230 lbs after a period.</p><h2>Life Outside The Prison Walls</h2><p>The former inmate left San Quentin State Prison for good around 2008.
