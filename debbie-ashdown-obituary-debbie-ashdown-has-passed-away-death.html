During Don’s high school career in Union City, Michigan, he excelled in a variety of sports, including football, basketball, baseball, and track and field, and he was awarded a total of 11 varsity letters as a result of his accomplishments.</p><p>In recognition of his remarkable athletic achievements, he was presented with the Michigan Prep Hall of Fame Award in the year 1946. This distinction was bestowed upon him. While Don was a senior in high school, he was fortunate enough to cross paths with Hazel Mae Wilcox, the woman who would go on to become the love of his life. After that, they got married, and their union has been going strong for the past 57 years. Both his wife Hazel and his son Mark went away in the years 2006 and 2015, respectively. Don was the first person to leave this world.</p><p>Don attended Albion College, where he also earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in Education and acquired a teaching certificate. After that, he furthered his studies by earning a Master of Science degree in Mathematics from Central Michigan University and a Master of Science degree in Secondary studies from Western Michigan University. Both of these degrees were achieved in Michigan. Teaching and coaching were Don’s two biggest passions in life. Over the course of his 45-year career as a teacher, he worked at three different high schools and three different universities, mostly instructing students in mathematics and computer science.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtp5Kewbat0bJlnKedZLGmrsGinGaZo52xsMPNZqaboaSqrrPFjJ2cm5qZmnqiv8edprCmXZ2utHnPmqqsnZRirrit2GabnpmknXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chris-redd-wife-age-height-wiki-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Chris Redd Wife, Age, Height, Wiki, Net Worth</span></a>
