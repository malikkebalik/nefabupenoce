However, she thought she had only been underground for about 160 or 170 days.</p><p>“When they came in to get me, I was asleep. I thought something had happened,” Flamini told reporters. “I said Already? Surely not.’ I hadn’t finished my book.”</p><p>Flamini’s 500-day adventure was part of a project called “Timecave.” The goal was to assess how a human would handle living underground for a long stretch of time.</p><p>As part of the experiment, experts examined the impacts of social isolation and extreme temporary disorientation on the human body.</p><p>“I’m still stuck on November 21, 2021,” Flamini told reporters on Friday, April 14. “I don’t know anything about the world.”</p><p>Flamini may have set a world record, too. Her team believes she holds the record for surviving the longest time while underground, though the Guinness Book of Records has yet to confirm.</p><p>She mentioned she never considered pressing the panic button she was given. She even survived a fly invasion, which left her covered in bugs.</p><p>The athlete also experienced “auditory hallucinations” while in the cave. She needed assistance standing up while speaking with reporters because of balance issues.</p><p>Still, Flamini was thrilled by the experience, which she called “excellent” and “unbeatable.”</p><p>“You have to remain conscious of your feelings,” Flamini said.</p><p>“If you’re afraid, that’s something natural but never let panic in or you get paralyzed.”</p><p>Watch the video below</p><p lang=es dir=ltr>😮 500 días bajo tierra en una cueva.
