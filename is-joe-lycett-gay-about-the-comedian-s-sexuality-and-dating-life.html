During a <a href=# rel="follow noopener">conversation with&nbsp;Unicorn</a> in&nbsp;April 2021, he&nbsp;revealed&nbsp;he was&nbsp;a pansexual man.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>That said, he also explained why people thought he was gay. As per him, he was attracted to men during his school, and because of that, he thought he must be gay. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"And then I did come out as gay, maybe towards the end of school, in sixth form," he said.</p><p>However, he soon realized that he also found girls really attractive, making him doubt his previous judgment about his sexuality.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><strong>An Instagram picture of Joe Lycett holding a trophy.</strong> (Photo: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><p>He continued to share, "So I realized I maybe I hadn't nailed it down. I ended up as bi. But these things happen quite slowly."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In addition, he also clarified that he was neither bisexual nor queer, saying the term "pan" perfectly described his sexuality. "...when I heard the word pan- how that just means 'all'- I thought yeah, fair enough. That sounds a bit more correct," he added. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Joe Lycett Admits Being a Pansexual Isn't Always Easy</h2><p>Speaking with the previous outlet,&nbsp;Lycett further discussed how society looked at people who were not straight and precisely towards&nbsp;pansexual people.</p><p>He shared that as he got older, he realized&nbsp;sexuality was an intangible thing, and some people weren't even bothered by one's sexuality.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>But according to him, there are also some places where&nbsp;being anything but straight was like a death sentence.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>He, therefore, felt people with similar experiences&nbsp;of sexuality need to help one another and encourage to&nbsp;speak when injustices take place.</p><p>"But in an ideal world, there would just be none of it. There would just be consent. And not hurting people," he stated.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Lycett also recalled when Liberal Democrats' MP Layla Moran received backlash for&nbsp;coming out as a pan. He said he was&nbsp;deeply affected by witnessing such hate.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Joe Lycett Tried Dating Apps in the Past</h2><p>On a rare occasion,&nbsp;the Epic Win announcer&nbsp;confirmed that he had tried out dating apps in an attempt to meet a potential partner. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"I've tried Tinder," he told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Sun</a>.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>However, he was not too impressed&nbsp;with the casual nature of the app, leading him to uninstall it sometime later. He explained he wanted something that made him feel more emotional and not sexual.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKKfmnqtxcKeq61loJa%2FtbrEq2SgmaljtbW5yw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./david-venable-s-house-in-downingtown-pa-explored.html><span>←</span><span>David Venable's House in Downingtown, PA Explored!</span></a>
