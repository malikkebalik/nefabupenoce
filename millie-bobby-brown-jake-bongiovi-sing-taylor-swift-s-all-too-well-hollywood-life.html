The actress, 18, and her boyfriend, 20, belted out “All Too Well” from <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Red (Taylor’s Version)</a> in a cute new black and white video shared to Millie’s Instagram on Thursday, Nov. 3. The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Stranger Things</a> star held onto an iced drink with her hair back in a ponytail as she reenacted the lyrics, singing directly to Jake who was driving a car.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“…pieces into place,” Millie mouthed along, moving her hands down to recreate Fall leaves. “And I can picture it, And I know it’s long gone and/That magic’s not here no more/And I might be okay, but I’m not fine at all<br>Oh, oh, oh,” the two sang via <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>, before Millie asked if Jake was “ready” for the next part which was the chorus.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“‘Cause there we are again on that little town street/You almost ran the red ’cause you were lookin’ over at me/Wind in my hair, I was there/I remember it all too well,” the couple — who <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>have been dating</a> since the summer of 2021 — belted right along Taylor, clearly passionate about the tune!</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Millie looked stylish in the video with a black pair of pajamas featuring white piping, as well as small gold hoop earrings. Meanwhile Jake, who is the son of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jon Bon Jovi</strong></a>, matched Millie’s black shirt with a t-shirt featuring a message against animal testing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Millie-Bobby-Brown-BF-Jake-Bongiovi-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>The cute video was featured in a dump which Millie captioned “last 6 months recap,” including other highlights with her cats, in hotel rooms, playing a game and doing dishes. In another short video, she was also seen watching an interview with actor <strong>Jamie Bower</strong> who is her co-star in&nbsp;Stranger Things&nbsp;as villain Henry Creel/Vecna.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“All Too Well” regained popularity last year after Taylor released a 10 minute version of the tune as part of her on-going efforts to re-record her past work after her masters were sold to <strong>Scooter Braun&nbsp;</strong>(he has since sold the masters, as well as the label Big Machine, to a private investment group as of Nov. 2020). The emotional break-up song is a highlight of&nbsp;Red, evidently inspired by her three month romance with <strong>Jake Gyllenhaal</strong> in 2010. At the time, Taylor was 20 and Jake was 29, which Taylor references in the lyrics. The country turned pop singer also told a fictionalized version of the relationship in a short film starring friend <strong>Sadie Sink</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye49sZqahnKG2pnnBqJmbsV2Xv7DDzWahmqOVYq%2Bwusaipq%2BhXai2r7OMrZiypJ%2BnerTDyJ%2BrZpmcoXq1u85mrp6knGLDqrDEqGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kate-langbroek.html><span>←</span><span>Kate Langbroek</span></a>
