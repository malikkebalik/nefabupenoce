Though the&nbsp;season had its usual ups and&nbsp;downs, tonight’s finale raised more questions than it answered: will Nicole ever forgive Jason? are Madison and Tony still in love? and who is Carla anyway?</p><p>While the jury is still out on the first two questions, we have some answers for you about the camera-shy Carla.</p><p>When Bruno first entered The Real World house, he appeared to click with Sylvia. The two had a fun connection and enjoyed the occasional make-out session… until Carla entered the picture.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Screen Shot 2015-03-11 at 12.06.03 AM" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-11-at-12.06.03-AM.png alt="Screen Shot 2015-03-11 at 12.06.03 AM" width=490 height=625 sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>At first it seemed like&nbsp;Carla was the typical, cliché&nbsp;local who falls for one of the Real Worlders, but as the season&nbsp;progressed, Bruno and Carla’s relationship became the real deal.</p><p>As&nbsp;Bruno’s feelings towards Carla grew, our knowledge about her didn’t. She quickly popped in one episode then out the next, and we saw her struggle with having their relationship play out on camera.</p><p>Towards the end of the season,&nbsp;Carla and Bruno had a&nbsp;short-lived break-up but were happy and very much together&nbsp;in the end.</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async title=Carla2 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Carla2-490x276.jpg alt=Carla2 width=490 height=276 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>The mysterious Carla is actually Carla Duca. She’s a smart cookie who&nbsp;graduated with honors from Dominican University, a Catholic college, where she&nbsp;double majored in Criminology and Sociology. However, these days you can find her using her skills as a makeup artist.</p><p>The 22-year-old lives in Chicago and showcases her artistry on her CarlaDucaMakeup&nbsp;<a href=#>Instagram page</a>&nbsp;but keeps her personal profile on lock down. During the time of filming,&nbsp;Carla worked the front desk at a Chicago hair salon&nbsp;and was a beauty advisor at Ulta before that. Currently, Carla is working as a Customer Service Associate for a garage door company located outside Chicago.</p><p>What about her and Bruno? Are they still together?</p><p>Not likely.</p><p>Bruno has made no mention of Carla on social media: no pictures on Instagram, no mentions on Twitter. It would appear as though the two aren’t in each other’s lives whatsoever.</p><p>In fact, we have solid evidence that Bruno has moved on with another Real Worlder:&nbsp;<span class=sorttext>Ashley Kelsey from The Real World season 26 in San Diego.&nbsp;</span></p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async title="Ashley Kelsey" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-10-at-11.51.38-PM.png alt="Ashley Kelsey" width=490 height=625 sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Ashley and Bruno seem to be very close, both posting this picture yesterday.</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async title="Ashley and Bruno" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-10-at-11.36.24-PM.png alt="Ashley and Bruno" width=490 height=598 sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Bruno also posted a pic to Twitter a few days ago with the caption, “I wonder who this is?” along with a kiss face emoji. We had to brighten up the photo to be sure, but no doubt it’s him and Ashley.</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async title="Bruno and Ashley 2" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Bruno-and-Ashley-2.jpg alt="Bruno and Ashley 2" width=490 height=876 sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>So let’s re-group: Carla appears to be a normal gal doing her 9-5 thing while Bruno is all over social media with a new girl.</p><p>I guess we will have to wait until the reunion show to know more, but it looks like Bruarla is officially&nbsp;over.</p><p>PHOTOS: Facebook / Instagram / Twitter</p><p><br><br><br></p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3><span class="share-item twitterbtn"><a href=# class=twitter-share-button data-via=starcasm>Tweet</a></span> <span class="share-item gplusbtn"></span><span class="share-item facebookbtn"></span><span class="share-item pinbtn"><a href=# class=pin-it-button count-layout=horizontal>Pin It</a></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpJa%2FpK3SpmWnnaRkv6aty2auqKqcmXq0t8SlnK2nnqh6o77Up6asZZeev62y0aKcp5xdmK6zuMBmqq2hnKF6tbvGnquhnaJk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-escucha-me-by-gipsy-kings.html><span>←</span><span>The Meaning Behind The Song: Escucha Me by Gipsy Kings</span></a>
