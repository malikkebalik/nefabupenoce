The show started airing in 2011, and Tim has been one of the main cast members throughout the series. All of his endeavors have helped put his net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Moonshiner’s Tim Smith? As of 2017, sources estimate a net worth that is at $500,000, earned through success in his numerous endeavors – he’s since opened his distillery while still participating with the reality show. As he continues his career, it is expected that his wealth will also continue to increase.</p><h3>Tim Smith Net Worth $500,000</h3><p>Tim is a third generation moonshiner, and first found popularity when he became one of the subjects of the show “Moonshiners”, and his net worth started increasing thanks to the opportunity.</p><p>“Moonshiners” is about the life of people who produce illegal moonshine in the Appalachian Mountains, and shows their liquor production, life, and law evading techniques. There has been controversy surrounding the show, as local officials have claimed it actually depicts no illegal liquor production. The Virginia Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) issued a statement that if the activities were illegal, law enforcement would have taken action, and have requested that the producers state that the show is a dramatization. The request was ignored and producers have stated that their content is real. Some parts of the series are taken from a documentary film entitled “This is the Last Dam Run of Likker I’ll Ever Make”, which depicted a moonshiner who was arrested and subsequently committed suicide.</p><p>Tim has been part of the show since it started airing in 2011, with the first season having seven episodes. The show has had a total of six seasons so far with the latest season going on for 17 episodes, adding up to a grand total of 83 episodes to date. Other regular cast members include moonshiners Tickle, Jesse, Mark, Lance, Jim Tom, Josh, and Bill, and the show has obviously proved successful as the viewing audience has remained well above a million for every episode, sometimes double that number, and certainly helped in increasing Tim’s net worth – in fact in 2013 a spinoff series was made entitled “Tickle”. Thanks to the money earned in the show, Smith then opened his own legal distillery located in Kentucky. His brand is called Climax Moonshine, and is for sale in several states, including Georgia, Tennessee, West Virginia and South Carolina.</p><p>For his personal life, it is known that Tim is married to Shelby and they have a son. He also does volunteer work, and is the Fire Chief of the Climax Volunteer Fire Department; his wife also works at the department. The fire department has released statements saying that the “Moonshiners” show is just a way to showcase the history and heritage of moonshining. Tim cannot state more about it since he’s under a contractual obligation with Discovery Channel. He’s been working for Climax since 2004, and when he’s not a part of the show, he also works as a mechanic.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjq2gpmWjora1tIynnK1lp6S%2FtbSO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rickey-smiley-is-on-grandpa-duty-in-this-cute-video-as-he-enjoys-playtime-with-his-grandkids.html><span>←</span><span>Rickey Smiley Is on Grandpa Duty in This Cute Video as He Enjoys Playtime with His Grandkids</span></a>
