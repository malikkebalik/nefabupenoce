Within a year of dating, the pair got engaged in January 2014.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>They got married six months later, on&nbsp;July 6, 2014, at Cohen's parents' home in British Columbia.

Then, there was no mention of divorce, but just the fact that they had a fallout and were working things out.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>They were still posting pictures of one another on their Instagram, and Braun even celebrated&nbsp;Cohen on their seventh wedding anniversary. In the&nbsp;now-deleted post, he thanked Cohen for helping him become the best version of himself.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Cohen&nbsp;replied in the comments,&nbsp;"A Team 4lyfe," hinting that the pair were still on good terms and perhaps, together.

However, the&nbsp;date of separation has not been announced.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Is Scooter Braun Dating Erika Jayne?</h2><p>Erika Jayne&nbsp;is an actress, singer, and television personality best known for The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills (RHOBH).

Recently, Jayne was dubbed as&nbsp;Braun's girlfriend, but the RHOBH star debunked all the rumors on the reality show's June 30, 2021 episode.&nbsp;</p><p>Jayne addressed the rumors with RHOBH co-stars Garcelle Beauvais and <a href=# rel=follow>Lisa Rinna</a>. Beauvais asked her if she visited an erotic shop with the celebrity manager, to which Jayne brushed it off and called the allegations&nbsp;"silly."&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>She confirmed she had not met Braun for the last four or five years.
