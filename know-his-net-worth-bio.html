Many have speculated that he was also one of the basketball players in his school days.</p><p>His wife, Tamika, was a professional basketball player with a 15-year-long career. During those fifteen years, she performed spectacularly, catching the eyes of many fans and clubs alike.</p><h2>He Is An Indiana Native</h2><p>Parnel Smith was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, on <strong>August 5, 1985</strong>. However, any information regarding his parents hasn't been disclosed yet. Standing at the height of 6 feet 6 inches (201 cm), he is a really tall man.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/14/parnell-smith-cerem-1671014484883.jpg><p>He completed his high school at Pike High School, located in Indiana. During his college days, he played basketball for the University at Buffalo.</p><h2>Parnell's Nervousness In The Date Night</h2><p>Parnel Smith first met Tamika Catchings in <strong>July 2014</strong> through a mutual friend. They dated for quite a while before Parnell finally proposed to Tamika. This is the recalled moment that Tamika told the reporter.</p><p>As Parnell was living in Rockford at the time and Tamika in Indianapolis, they were far apart from each other. They were going out on a date night. Tamika said:</p><p>"And he arranged a car service to come pick me up and I was kind of like, 'Oh you know I'd rather drive myself. I can drive Downtown. He was like, 'No, because afterward I want to be able to get in the car together and go home.' "</p><p>So they went for a fancy dinner at a hotel, and the waitress asked if it was any special occasion, to which she replied:</p><p>"No. No. Just here for date night, the official date night. "&nbsp;</p><p>Tamika recalled that Parnell was kinda nervous about the dinner.</p><h2>Parnell Smith's Proposal</h2><p>The lovely pair Parnell & Tamika&nbsp;went upstairs after dinner. Then Parnell handed out the iPad that he had in his hand and asked Tamika to check it out. There were pictures of them together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/14/623c9a08-4132-4a78-b274-5d21f79f29f7_1140x641-1671014557282.jpg><p>After the images and song playing in the background paused, Parnell got to his knees:</p><p>"I'm just so thankful for the opportunity that I met you and I'm so blessed that God brought you into my life. I just have one question."</p><p>Then the screen flashed, asking for the marriage, to which Tamika said Yes.</p><h2>The Marriage of Parnell Smith & Tamika Catchings</h2><p>Parnell Married Tamika in <strong>February 2016</strong>, two years after their first meeting. The wedding ceremony was held at the Skyline Club. Before the betrothal, they took cute pictures together at Bankers Life Fieldhouse and Monument Circle.</p><p>Only friends and family were invited to the weddings. The total number of people gathered at the wedding was twenty-seven. It shows that even if the ceremony was small, it was really special for both of them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/14/parnell%20with%20his%20wife-1671014709557.jpg><p>It has been several years since they got married, but they still haven't given birth to any child. They have expressed their desire to have some, but for now, it seems they are happy as it is.</p><h2>Parnell Smith's Wife's Net Worth</h2><p>There are many estimations of Tamika Catchings's net worth. Most of them have estimated it to be approximately <strong>$300 thousand</strong>, similar to the net worth of <a href=# rel=nofollow>Michelle Mylett</a>.</p><p>It is a fair estimation considering that Tamika had a salary of $105,000 in 2012. However, no one will be surprised if her real net worth is in the millions, as she hasn't officially revealed her net worth.</p><h2>Social Media Presence</h2><p>The social media of Parnell Smith hasn't been disclosed to the public yet, but his wife, Tamika, is very active on her social media accounts.</p><p>Tamika has garnered over <strong>85k </strong>followers on her verified Instagram <a href=# rel=nofollow>@catchin24</a> and frequently posts over there, keeping her followers up to date.
