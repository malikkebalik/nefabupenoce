Then you win a Champions League or you don't, or a League… It depends on many factors. What is the result of effort and dedication is this entire trajectory. I'm proud of that, yes."</p><p>Politics was always on the mind of Oleguer, though, who also won two LaLiga titles.</p><p>As his teammates played for the Spanish national team, he opted not to as a proud Catalan in the mid 2000s, just before the nation conquered the footballing world.</p><p>"I did not feel this commitment to a national team that does not represent me in any way. On the contrary, it generates rejection and aversion in me for what it represents," he said.</p><p>"The conversation with [Spain manager at the time] Luis Aragones was very frank, honest and calm.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/04/r-catalunya-duels-ball-gonzalo-809648095.jpg><p>"It's not that I can't feel comfortable, it's also that I'm not interested. I haven't seen or followed the European Championships or the World Cups, it doesn't have much sense."</p><p>His views, though, polarised opinion at the time.</p><p>"When you're in the thick of it, some picked me up as an icon because of what I said and some hated me. I was always quite aware of that," he added.</p><p>Oleguer is perhaps a more relaxed figure now than in a rebellious youth, which saw him co-author a book about his life so far and commitment to Catalonian nationalism and anti-fascism after winning the league title in 2004/05.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/04/oleguer-barcelona-zidane-real-madrid-809647753.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/04/real-oleguer-barcelona-location-barcelona-809647912.jpg><p><a href=# aria-label="Promoting it, he said (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Promoting it, he said</a>: "I know that everything I say can have a lot of repercussion, but in what sense?

And we have to dream, whatever the cost, because it is the only way to get closer, even if it is with the slow passage of time, to the utopia. We have to be optimistic.
