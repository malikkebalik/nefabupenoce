You can't have a party without balloons, and we have 50 amazing hot air balloons coming down to the park," said co-founder Laurie Spencer. She and her late husband, Scott, created this event for the community to enjoy.</p><p>The event begins Wednesday, Aug. 30, with CapEd Kids Day, where every kid in the park may enjoy at least one free-tethered ride in a hot air balloon.</p><p>"We're teaching those kids. We teach them math. They don't know we're teaching them math, but we're teaching them math. We teach them how balloons work. We talk about the size of the balloon," Laurie added. "It's one of the things that I enjoy about the pilots that we bring here. They love ballooning as much as I do, and they love sharing the sport, and that's what we get to do with our people."</p><p>Laurie, a long-time pilot herself, says the pilots enjoy talking to families. You are welcome to ask them or their crew any of your questions about ballooning.</p><p>CBS2 will bring live coverage from the Spirit of Boise each morning.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihlJa1sLrEsKpnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxmpaeTlrlwuMCbpqtllJbGbsPEnqKeppRiwaK3xKxkn6SZnLW1edaiq6Flo6W2s7XTZqafZZKktrSxjJuYpaSfpLtur8uaqqyhkw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-brianna-pinnix-racist-racism-controversy-and-comments.html><span>←</span><span>Is Brianna Pinnix Racist | Racism Controversy And Comments</span></a>
