The goal halved the deficit for Barcelona as Xavi’s side came from two goals down to draw 2-2.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>It caps a week that saw Yamal&nbsp;sign a new three-year contract to keep him at Barcelona until 2026 following approaches from clubs across Europe.</p><p>The goal sees the winger break yet another record this year; <span>he came off the bench&nbsp;<a href=#><span class=s2>against Real Betis in May to become the youngest player in La Liga history</span></a> at 15 years and 290 days old.&nbsp;</span>Jamal then became the club’s youngest starter — at 16 years and 38 days old — against Cadiz in August, and then <a class=ath_autolink data-id=788 href=#>Spain</a>’s youngest international player and goalscorer aged 16 years and 57 days when he came off the bench and scored in a 7-1 win against Georgia in September.</p><p>He has made 11 appearances for Barcelona this season, five of which have come as a starter, and has provided two assists.</p><p>Yamal was supposed to be more involved with Barcelona Atletic, the club’s second team, this term. But after his breakthrough this season — including with&nbsp;<a href=#><span>Spain</span></a> — he is expected to remain with the first team.</p><p>Barcelona were held to a 2-2 draw by Malaga on Sunday evening to leave them third heading into October’s international break.</p><p><a class=ath_autolink data-id=mVFv9uS5MXjCmiH3 href=#>Bryan Zaragoza</a> had struck twice inside the opening half an hour to give the hosts a 2-0 lead before Yamal pulled one back on the stroke of half time. <a class=ath_autolink data-id=Bunmb6UKRFiDb6lT href=#>Sergi Roberto</a> equalised five minutes from time for the visitors, who were then denied a late winner by the offside flag.</p><p>Barcelona return to action on October 22 against Athletic Bilbao.</p><a href=# class=go-deeper><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128" alt=go-deeper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=go-deeper-label>GO DEEPER</p><p class=go-deeper-title>Lamine Yamal: Barcelona’s 15-year-old talent 'who can define an era'</p></a><h3>‘The brightest youth prospect at the club’</h3><p>Analysis from Barcelona Correspondent Pol Ballus</p><p class=p2>There is a consensus among those who closely follow Barcelona’s La Masia academy that Yamal can be regarded as the brightest youth prospect at the club right now.</p><p class=p2>Yamal joined Xavi’s first-team training sessions at the start of last season. The club ignored the fact he had not even been in a matchday squad for Barcelona Atletic, the club’s B team, let alone make his debut with them. Yamal has followed a similar path to <a class=ath_autolink data-id=9ACowrmXJKJKTUi5 href=#>Gavi</a>, who also joined the first team straight from the under-19s.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p class=p2>But while Gavi arrived from <a class=ath_autolink data-id=1213 href=#>Real Betis</a>, Yamal is a local boy. He was born in Esplugues de Llobregat, roughly halfway between Camp Nou and Barcelona’s training ground, although he grew up in the nearby towns of Mataro and Granollers. Barca recruited him when he was six and playing for local club La Torreta.</p><p class=p2>Yamal is a left-footed attacker who can operate on either flank, but his favoured role is on the right wing. He has an excellent ability to handle the ball at his feet, especially when performing his signature move, cutting inside from the right to end up in central positions. His physical development is advanced for a 16-year-old, and he’s also had no major injuries. This has all helped fuel his rapid progression.</p><p>(Photo: Fran Santiago/Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57k3Jra2xgbXxzfJFsZmpoX2WFcLjApqCnnV2urq6ty2aZmqqTmrmwusBmo5plnJ60onnSnKarnaJk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wu-jing-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Wu Jing Net Worth</span></a>
