Emma&nbsp;was a cheerleader at Central High School in Knoxville, Tennessee when she was, naturally, in a relationship with football player&nbsp;<strong>William&nbsp;Riley Gaul</strong>, 18. But it wasn’t until their romance ran its course&nbsp;that Emma’s life was in taken by the man she once trusted the most. William was arrested on Nov. 22, just one day after&nbsp;shooting Emma inside her home. Then, on Nov. 23, he was charged with murder.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>[jwplatform 0sB61C8n]</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The couple broke up just a few weeks before the murder, but according to Emma’s aunt,&nbsp;<strong>Jenny Weldon</strong>, William refused to accept the split. “She had chosen to move on,” Jenny told the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Knoxville News Sentinel</a>. “He refused to accept it. He chose not to accept her wishes.” Driven with fury that Emma no longer wanted to continue their relationship, William stood outside her house in the early morning and fired a gun into her bedroom while she was sleeping.</p><h3>Nicole Lovell Murder Case — Shocking Pics</h3><p id=content-paragraph-5>But this is where it gets really twisted. Mere hours after shooting her, William wrote a lengthy message on Twitter professing his love her for. “To think that every memory we have, every happy special moment we shared, can’t ever be relived,” he posted. “I love you Emma Jane Walker.” William is currently posted with a $750,000 bond at Knox County Jail, and will face court within the upcoming days on account of first degree murder.&nbsp;During their happier times, William accompanied Emma to her high school prom, and she’d often attend his football games at Maryville College.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, please leave your kind words and prayers for Emma’s family during this difficult time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlmZH5ye5FuZrChnKG2ormMq6ClnalitKLBy2aYq6qVqMGmsIyepKaZXayurbfEq2SmraKZsrN7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./victoria-granucci-dating-ex-husband-john-mellencamp-married-now.html><span>←</span><span>Victoria Granucci Dating, Ex-Husband, John Mellencamp, Married, Now</span></a>
