When the girls started to drive, Yearwood and her husband, Garth Brooks, quickly realized how difficult it was to have them all in the same room, which is when they introduced "veggie night."</p><p class=Fg>"Veggie night" was simultaneously the one night a week when the whole family was together and a way to get their children to eat more vegetables, according to Yearwood.

Yearwood sat in a car in a grey hoodie with a pair of seeing glasses on.</p><p class=Fg>The photo showed Yearwood smiling sans makeup and proudly sporting an "I Voted" sticker on her shoulder. Her hoodie was spattered with raindrops, and the singer said she hadn't let the wet weather get in the way of her voting.</p><p class=Fg>While some fans were impressed that Yearwood had braved the weather to go and make her voice heard, others were impressed with her appearance in the photos.
