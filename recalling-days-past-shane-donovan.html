As Shane Donovan, Charles Shaughnessy was a regular fixture in Salem from 1984 – 1992 and briefly returned for a stint in 2002. Since leaving his popular role as the super suave ISA agent, Shaughnessy has enjoyed much success in primetime, the theatre and animation.</p><p>For those of you who don’t remember, the Brit came to Salem to keep an eye on Stefano DiMera and quickly teamed up with Bo to take him down. Later, on a mission to England, Bo, Hope, Kimberly and Shane tracked a terrorist named the “Dragon” and Kim and Shane fell in love. Of course their romance would face many obstacles including his presumed dead wife, Kim’s blindness, Victor Kiriakis, the daughter Shane never knew he had and his twin brother. In the midst of all this drama, the two married and had a child named Andrew.</p><p>Sadly, the supercouple didn’t last. Believing Shane was killed on an ISA assignment, Kimberly took up with Cal. When Shane returned, Kim discovered she was pregnant and due to Cal’s manipulations, believed he was the father. By the time they figured out Jeannie was really Shane’s baby, it was too late for the couple and Kimberly left Salem.</p><p>Shortly after Kimberly left, her sister Kayla’s husband Steve was “murdered.” Shane invited Kayla and her daughter, Stephanie to move in with him and the two quickly bonded and fell in love. Kim returned to Salem and the tension between the sisters became too much of a strain on Shane and Kayla’s relationship and they broke up. Kayla moved to L.A. and Shane moved back to England. He briefly returned to Salem in 2002 when Hope was kidnapped by Larry Welch, who was part of the reason he came to Salem in the first place.</p><p>Now that you’re all caught up on Shane, what’s become of his portrayer? Since his time on <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>Days</strong></a>, Charles Shaughnessy has guest starred in a slew of primetime TV series including, “Murphy Brown,” “Mad About You,” “Sabrina the Teenage Witch,” “She Spies,” “Stargate SG-1,” “Veronica Mars” and “Law and Order: SVU.” He was also a regular on MyNetwork TV’s short-lived telenovela, “Saints & Sinners” and of course enjoyed a six year run on “The Nanny,” co-starring Fran Drescher.</p><p>Aside from his daytime and primetime success, Shaughnessy received an Emmy for his voice-over work as Dennis the goldfish in the Disney cartoon series, “Stanley,” made his Broadway debut in the Tony award winning musical “Urinetown,” recently enjoyed a run in “Orson’s Shadow” at the Pasadena Playhouse in California and will soon be seen in the upcoming feature, “Polar Opposites.”</p><p>While this married father of two certainly keeps busy, he makes plenty of time for his fans.
