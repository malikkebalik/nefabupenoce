Follow with a nice smelling deodorant like the <strong>Degree Motion Sense DrySpray Ultraclear Black + White.</strong> It won’t leave white marks on black sheets and won’t create yellow stains on white clothing.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Make sure your legs are silky smooth by prepping with a razor like the&nbsp;new and improved <strong><span class=il>Schick</span> Hydro Silk</strong>.
